[Nuxt.js](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js) is a gift to the Vue community.  Building Vue universal applications is not an easy task and the Nuxt.js framework has greatly simplified the process.  Some immediate benefits include:

1. Less boilerplate for managing code reuse between server and client.
2. Get up and going with your development environment instantly with hot-reloading.
3. Simplified paging.
